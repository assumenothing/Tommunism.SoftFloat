# Tommunism.SoftFloat
Tommunism.SoftFloat is a software implementation of binary floating-point that conforms to the IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic.
This software was been ported to C# by Thomas Kaiser from the C source code originally built by John R. Hauser.

Original C library this was derived from:
http://www.jhauser.us/arithmetic/SoftFloat.html

This library requires .NET 6 to use as it requires several advanced C# and .NET features which are only available on this platform.
